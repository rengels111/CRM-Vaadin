# Flow CRM 

This is my Java Spring Boot & Vaadin project.
It is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) full-stack web application that manages contacts and includes a few features:
- Log-in screen to restrict access.
- Responsive layout with side navigation for desktop and mobile devices.
- Database for permanent data storage.
- List view that can be sorted and filtered.
- Form for editing and adding contacts.
- Dashboard view.
- Cloud provisioning.
- App installation on mobile devices and desktops.
